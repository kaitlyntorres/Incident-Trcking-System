# Incident Tracking System
In this project, you must design, develop, and test a web-based issue tracking system. Issue tracking systems are a collaborative system for maintaining a list of outstanding items. Organizational IT support is a common example, where a request leads to a generation of a "ticket" which is added to the issue tracking system until it is updated/resolved.
